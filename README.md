# Furniture-Website-Project-4
Furniture Website

The aim of this project was to create an e-commerce furniture store that is responsive, interactive and engaging for a user that encourages the user to stay longer on the site and purchase goods.

The website was created using HTML for the structure of the website, CSS for the superficial design and javascript for the interactivity. Bootstrap libraries were ustilised in the aid of the design to produce a powerful and structured website that would bring the website to life through bootsraps pwoerful plugins.

The wesbite is designed with 4 main pages: 

A nav bar is used for the user to easily access any of the pages at anytime.

  - Home Page - The first page which hosts the furniture range and details through a carousel for the user to click through.
  
  - About Page - To give the user some context to the team behind the business and the aim of the business in providing furniture to customers.
  
  - The Range Page - This page is the store area where the user can add a product to the shopping basket for purchasing. The basket calculates the total of each line item based on the cost of the product and the number of items selected by the user. The grand total is updated automatically based on the totals of each row in the basket.
  
  - Contact Page - Allows the user to fill out a form to get in contact with the business with queries/questions about the products or process of purchasing etc. Also on this page are details of the location of the business with an address provided and a google maps insert.
